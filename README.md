**Key Insights:**

✅ Monetary value (M_score) is balanced  
✅ **Problem is Recency (R), not spending power**  
✅ At Risk customers WILL spend if re-engaged  

**Business Action:**
- Focus on **frequency & recency**, not discounts
- At Risk customers have proven spending power
- Win-back offers should focus on:

**Segmentation Strategy:**
```
HIGH VALUE AT RISK (M_score = 4, R_score = 1)
→ Personal outreach, white-glove service, early access

MEDIUM VALUE AT RISK (M_score = 2-3, R_score = 1)
→ Automated email campaigns, 15-20% offers

LOW ENGAGEMENT OTHERS (M_score = 2-3, R_score = 2)
→ Nurture with content, build to Loyal tier
